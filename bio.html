        <p>
            My name is Frank Hattler. I was born in Palo Alto, CA during the fall of 1995. Childhood was great. I enjoyed playing in the park building legos and hanging out with friends.

            Everything changed when school started. I had to sit in a classroom and learn the alphabet and how to count. I could never see how this information would ever be useful. After a few years though, I finally came around. I began to see that being able to read was very useful and counting helped out a lot too.

            Skip ahead a few years and now I'm at Tufts University. Medford is not as sunny as California, but life is still great. More to come.
